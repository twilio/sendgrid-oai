  title: Twilio SendGrid IP Warmup API
  summary: The Twilio SendGrid IP Warm Up API allows you to gradually increasing the
    volume of mail sent with a dedicated IP address according to a predetermined schedule.
  description: 'The Twilio SendGrid IP Warm Up API allows you to gradually increasing
    the volume of mail sent with a dedicated IP address according to a predetermined
    schedule. This gradual process helps to establish a reputation with ISPs (Internet
    Service Providers) as a legitimate email sender.


    SendGrid can automatically warm up dedicated IP addresses by limiting the amount
    of mail that can be sent through them per hour. The limit is determined by how
    long the IP address has been warming up.


    See the [warmup schedule](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/warming-up-an-ip-address/#automated-ip-warmup-hourly-send-schedule)
    to learn how SendGrid limits your email traffic for IPs in warmup.


    You can also choose to use Twilio SendGrid''s automated IP warmup for any of your
    IPs from the **IP Addresses** settings menu in the [Twilio SendGrid application
    user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/ip_addresses).'
